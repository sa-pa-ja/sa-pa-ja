# 🚀 From the Highlands to Code & Adventure  Horsesback Trail Cusco

Born in a **Quechua-speaking community**, our journey started in a place with limited education and few opportunities. Thanks to the vision and support of our brother **Nico Patiño Jauja**, who had already experienced university life, we moved to Cusco. He believed his siblings deserved better opportunities and a brighter future beyond our hometown.

With the guidance of **Nico** and our uncles **Celso Jauja Pinares** and **Policarpo Jauja Pinares**, we embraced new challenges, learned Spanish, and became part of the **horse-riding adventure business** they pioneered in Cusco. This experience fueled our dream of building our own company.

Our academic journey led us to study **Economics at the National University of San Antonio Abad in Cusco**, where our love for numbers and mathematics deepened. It was here that we took our first steps into programming through **Stata and EViews**, igniting a passion for technology.

Driven by the need to create a website for our horseback adventure, we faced challenges—including fraud—but turned setbacks into learning opportunities. We mastered **JavaScript, React, Flask**, moved beyond WordPress, and expanded into **digital marketing with Meta Ads Suite, Instagram Ads, and Google Ads**.

Today, Horsesback Trail Cusco is more than an adventure—it is a story of resilience, growth, and innovation, merging tourism and technology to create unforgettable experiences. 🚀🐎
